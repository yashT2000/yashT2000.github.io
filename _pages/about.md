Hi there! I’m Yash, and I’m thrilled you’ve found your way here. This website is a collection of things that I’m passionate or curious about. From my personal projects and course work to random bits of knowledge I find fascinating, from math, science or even movie reviews. I am primarily interested in math/stat, but I’m genuinely curious about a lot more! Whether it’s a new concept in science or just something that piques my interest, I enjoy diving into a variety of topics.

Feel free to explore, and I hope you find something that sparks your curiosity, too!
