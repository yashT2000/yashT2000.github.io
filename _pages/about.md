Hi there! I’m Yash, and I’m thrilled you’ve found your way here.

This site is a mix of things I’m working on or just find interesting. You’ll find personal projects, course projects, quick intros to papers, random math stuff, facts I stumble on, and the occasional movie review(work in progress). My main interests lie in math and a bit of physics, but honestly, I’m curious about all sorts of things.

Feel free to look around — maybe something here will catch your interest too.
